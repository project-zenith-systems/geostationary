# Example TODO.md

This file demonstrates the format expected by the `todo-to-issues.yml` workflow.

When pushed to the `main` branch, this workflow will:
1. Parse TODO items in markdown checkbox format
2. Create GitHub issues for each item
3. Include context from markdown headers in issue descriptions
4. Delete this file and commit with `[skip ci]`

## Usage Format

Use markdown checkboxes for TODO items:

# Feature Category

- [ ] First task to do
- [ ] Second task to do
- [x] Completed task (will also create an issue)

# Another Category

- [ ] Task under different context

Headers (using # or ##, etc.) are captured as context and included in the issue body.
